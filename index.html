            <h1>Chinchilla Care</h1>
            <p>Chinchilla care requires time and understanding. Proper care is one of the most important aspects of owning a chinchilla. Chinchillas require more care than putting them in a cage and giving them fresh food a few times a week. There are many aspects of proper care for you chinchilla. </p>
            
            <p>First and foremost, time is one of the most important things in caring for you little fluff ball. Chinchillas are social creatures by nature and require interaction with their owner or another pet chinchilla.</p>
            
            <p>Chinchillas have a sensitive digestive tract, which requires a nutritious high fiber diet. It is important to know which foods and treats they can safely consume that do not disturb their sensitive system.</p>
            
            <p>Another aspect of proper chinchilla care is having safe chinchilla toys to chew. Having plenty of toys not only helps ensure proper care of you chinchillaâ€™s ever-growing teeth, but it also provides entertainment and joy to your pet.</p>
            
            <h2>Chinchillas as Pets</h2>
            <p>Chinchillas make wonderful pets for the right family, and tend not to be recommended for young children. Children tend to be overbearing with affection and could harm a chinchilla or frighten it. Although they are loving and social animals by nature, they require gentle handling. Chinchillas are very smart, curious, and loving animals. They are active animals and very entertaining to watch. Chinchillas are social creatures and need a lot of interaction, and tend to have a strong bond with their owner. A lone chinchilla requires a great deal of attention, and can become withdrawn and avoidant when lonely. If you are unable to devote time to your chinchilla, it would be best to have two chinchillas. That allows them to play and interact with one another without being dependent on their owner for attention.</p>
